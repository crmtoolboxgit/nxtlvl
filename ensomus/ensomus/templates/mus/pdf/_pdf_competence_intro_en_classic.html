<h2>Part 2: Skills Key</h2>
<p>
    You have now come to the second part of the preparation guide. The Skills Key is a list of specially selected skills
    that the CDD contains.
</p>
<p>
<div class="well">
    <em>
        Skills are about how you use your abilities, knowledge and proficiencies in the daily work tasks. There are two
        possible development paths; one is to get better at something you are already good at and the other is to
        develop completely new skills that are relevant to your work. Everybody possess the skills that are listed, but
        it differs to what extent we use and utilise them.
    </em>
</div>
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of the Skills Key is to gain knowledge and understanding of the skills that make the most sense for you
    to develop and focus on in relation to your work.
</p>
<p>
    The Skills Key contains 9 skills fields, where each field contains 3 skills. YThe focus in this yearâ€™s dialogue is
    on {{ competence_fields|length }} fields of competences. These will be the overall framework for the preparation and
    the dialogue. The {{ competence_fields|length }} skills fields are: <strong>
    {% for competence_field in competence_fields %}{% if forloop.last %} &amp; {% elif not forloop.first %}, {% endif %}
        {{ competence_field.title }}{% endfor %}.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The skills in column 1 and column 2 (personal and social skills) are generally applicable to all work areas and
    companies, while the skills in column 3 (professional skills) are specific to your company.
</p>
<p>
    The following list of columns and skills shows all 9 skills fields. Since skills fields may overlap each other, all
    skills fields are shown, but you must prepare yourself based on the {{ competence_fields|length }} selected skills
    fields.
