                Skills are about how the employees uses their abilities, knowledge and proficiencies in the daily work tasks. There are two possible development paths; one is to get better at something the employee is already good at and the other is to develop completely new skills that are relevant to the work. Everybody possess the skills that are listed, but it differs to what extent we use and utilise them.

        <p>
            The purpose of the Skills Key is to gain knowledge and understanding of the skills that make the most sense for the employee to develop and focus on in relation to their work.

             The Skills Key contains 9 skills fields, where each field contains 3 skills. YThe focus in this yearâ€™s dialogue is on <span data-ng-bind="getCompetenceFieldCount()"></span> fields of competences. These will be the overall framework for the preparation and the dialogue. The <span data-ng-bind="getCompetenceFieldCount()"></span> skills fields are: <strong><span data-ng-repeat="cf in getCompetenceFields()"><span data-ng-if="!$last && !$first">,&nbsp;</span><span data-ng-if="$last">&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;</span>{{ cf.name}}</span>.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The skills in column 1 and column 2 (personal and social skills) are generally applicable to all work areas and companies, while the skills in column 3 (professional skills) are specific to the company.
        </p>
