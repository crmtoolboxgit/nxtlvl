            <em>
                Skills are about how you use your abilities, knowledge and proficiencies in the daily work tasks. There
                are two possible development paths; one is to get better at something you are already good at and the
                other is to develop completely new skills that are relevant to your work. Everybody possess the skills
                that are listed, but it differs to what extent we use and utilise them.
            </em>
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of the Skills Key is to gain knowledge and understanding of the skills that make the most sense
            for you to develop and focus on in relation to your work.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Skills Key contains 9 skills fields, where each field contains 3 skills. YThe focus in this yearâ€™s
            dialogue is on <span data-ng-bind="getCompetenceFieldCount()"></span> fields of competences. These will be
            the overall framework for the preparation and the dialogue. The <span
                data-ng-bind="getCompetenceFieldCount()"></span> skills fields are: <strong><span
                data-ng-repeat="cf in getCompetenceFields()"><span data-ng-if="!$last && !$first">,&nbsp;</span><span
                data-ng-if="$last">&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;</span>{{ cf.name }}</span>.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            The skills in column 1 and column 2 (personal and social skills) are generally applicable to all work areas
            and companies, while the skills in column 3 (professional skills) are specific to your company.
        </p>

        <p>
            The following list of columns and skills shows all 9 skills fields. Since skills fields may overlap each
            other, all skills fields are shown, but you must prepare yourself based on the <span

        <p>
            The preparation is intended to get you to reflect on your skills in relation to your current and future work
            tasks, so you can get the focus it takes to develop them and solve your tasks in an even better way.

            you have to ease off your skills, it all depends on your experience, your personality and the nature of the
            task.
